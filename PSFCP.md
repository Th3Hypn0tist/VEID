# Phase-Synchronized Field-Coupled Propulsion
## Abstract
A conceptual model for a propulsion mechanism exploiting phase-shifted internal oscillations to exchange momentum with an external gravitational field.

## 1. Background
- Conservation of momentum and limitations of perfectly closed systems.
- The impossibility of total isolation due to omnipresent gravitational and field interactions.

## 2. Principle
- Internal masses perform phase-synchronized oscillations.
- At specific timing, part of the energy couples asymmetrically to the ambient field.
- The resulting micro-impulse propagates through the field, generating net translation.

## 3. Mathematical framework
- System of N masses {m_i} connected by springs {k_ij}.
- Equations of motion in an external potential φ(x, y, z).
- Momentum exchange term ∂P_field/∂t = −∑_i m_i ∂φ/∂x_i.

## 4. Experimental considerations
- Sensitive measurement setup in partial vacuum.
- Detection of net drift relative to inertial reference.
- Control tests with symmetric phasing.

## 5. Discussion
- Relationship to field-coupled and radiation-reaction drives.
- Energy efficiency limits and thermal losses.

## 6. Conclusion
The model does not violate conservation laws but exploits the unavoidable openness of any physical system. Further experimental verification is required.
